# Advanced MLOps Course

This repository contains the code for the Advanced MLOps course. I have focused on the following topics:

1. [Part 1](1_k8s/): Basic usage of Kubernetes
2. [Part 2](2_k8s_kubeflow/): Setting up piplelines with kubeFlow
3. [Part 3](3_distributed_training/): Distributed training with pytorch & tensorflow in the cloud

## Part 1 - Kubernetes

In this part, we will learn how to use Kubernetes to deploy docker containers.

## Part 2 - Kubeflow

In this part, we will learn how to use Kubeflow to deploy a simple machine learning model.

## Part 3 - Distributed training

In this part we will explore how machine learning models can be trained in a distributed manner.

# Advanced MLOps Course

This repository contains the code for the Advanced MLOps course. The course is divided into 5 parts:

1. [Part 1](1_k8s/): Basic usage of Kubernetes
2. [Part 2](2_k8s_kubeflow/): Setting up piplelines with kubeFlow
3. [Part 3](3_distributed_training/): Distributed training with Kubeflow
4. [Part 4](4_seldon/): Serving models with Seldon
4. [Part 4](5_cloudflare/): Serving models with Cloudflare Workers

# Advanced MLOps Course

This repository contains the code for the Advanced MLOps course. The course is divided into 5 parts:

1. [Part 1](1_k8s/): Basic usage of Kubernetes
2. [Part 2](2_k8s_kubeflow/): Setting up piplelines with kubeFlow
3. [Part 3](3_distributed_training/): Distributed training with pytorch & tensorflow
4. [Part 4](4_hosting/): Serving models with Cloudflare Workers

## Setup

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [KubeFlow](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/getting-started/)
